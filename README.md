## Your very own Media Conversion Tool (lite)

###### Limitations: The *lite* tag indicates the simplicity of the tool. It is a one at a time operation, meant to give the user easy 1,2,3 steps to get their desired outcome. Due to the nature of its simplicity - options are limited to about 20. But the script is well structured, about 200 lines of code, it can be easily forked and modified to fully utilize the power of FFMPEG.

## Brief Description

This tool is a simple Bash script that utilizes the FFMPEG library. It gives the user very easy 1-2-3 steps to convert different media files (gif,mp4,mkv,webm,webp) to different types with different formats and different flavors.

The script can be run in any directory, you can even **drag & drop** your media file into the script and it will detect it!

You can review the ffmpeg log, and navigate between the Main Menu to start over again.
